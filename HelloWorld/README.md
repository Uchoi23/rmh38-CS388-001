## Notes

* Warnings when a string was written for the text of a button or text view, in favor of a string variable refrence.
* Using tools:srcCompat instead of app:srcCompat or android:src did not show the image in the emulator. Only in the editor.
* Restablishing the bountries of each element by dragging the arrow sometimes moved the entire screen to that direction.
